          HM Land Registry’s Digital and Data transformation programmes will deliver a new generation of end-to-end land and property registration and data services. Currently, applications to change our registers are based around paper or PDF forms, supported by manual checking processes which are highly effective but time-consuming and expensive to provide.  Our wider transformation programme will deliver digital services that will improve usability and collect validated data in order to make it simpler, cheaper and faster to view, create or change registered property information. We are using state-of-the-art fraud detection to protect the integrity of the register and transforming our internal systems, replacing multiple paper-based processes with a single, digital solution with high levels of automation. <br><br>We are currently bolstering our Analysis and Insight capability within our Digital, Data and  Technology (DDaT) Directorate to tackle some of these challenges. We are looking for collaborative support in developing practical applications, across the full spectrum of work within our Data Science, Data Management and Analysis and Performance Analysis Practices, to consolidate in-house skills, develop knowledge and build live services for internal and external users.

          To achieve our ambitions to develop and deliver digital services and enable the disaggregation and release of core register data sets as bespoke products and services we are looking for a partner to support our existing capability, help demonstrate the art of the possible across HMLR business areas and collaborate on building live, production systems. <br><br>We envision a range of activities – from designing and implementing real time data visualization, geospatial mapping, timeseries analysis, development of Machine Learning models and production deployment of Deep Learning based services - over the next 12 – 24 months. A Capability Partner will support our delivery teams and provide embedded subject matter expertise. We need to be able to react quickly to changes in demand, ensure we have the right people on the right teams to meet our programme goals and objectives and inject new knowledge and experience into our organisation. <br><br>We are looking to accelerate our transformation programme in a relatively short timeframe (3 – 4 years). HMLR will be developing large scale data engineering, analysis and machine learning pipelines along with dedicated data platforms to transform the capability of the organisation, provide efficiency savings and create novel data products and internal/external services.
